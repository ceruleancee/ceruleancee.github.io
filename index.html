<p>Hello, I'm Cee and this is my garbage homepage (for now) for learning html, css and javascript. I'm mainly a backend
    developer who sucks at frontend work, But I learn by doing, so this site is meant to remedy my sucky frontend work.</p>
<p> My <i>actual</i> website is at <a href="https://cobaltclaudia.tech">cobaltclaudia.tech</a></p>
<p>Byeeeee!</p>
