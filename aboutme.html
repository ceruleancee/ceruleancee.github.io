        <h1> About Claudia!</h1>
            <p>Computer scientist. software engineer. Texan. Book nerd. Creative creature. Circa Survive fan Âèà.
                Hey, how‚Äôs it going! Not sure as to how you ended up here, but pretty glad you‚Äôre here.
                Anyways, I‚Äôm Claudia. I‚Äôm a recently graduated computer science student from Texas State University, turned software engineer. Before that I was an infosec professional for almost 4 years.
                I don‚Äôt claim to know everything in IT, but not knowing is half the fun, hence why I‚Äôve started this blog. Here I figured I might jot down my journey of learning anything there is to learn about in IT, random tech interests, thoughts and news that I just care to talk about, all in hopes that maybe someone might listen.
                My major has taught me several of the basic foundations you need to be in any IT profession, coding in multiple languages, databases, cyber security, software engineering, computer architecture, even some machine learning.
                But much like us all, I‚Äôm hoping to find my true passion and fulfillment in this industry. Currently my interest and enthusiasm is heavily focused on coding and infoSec, specifically more on the tech side of things. Things such as coding, networking, automation procedures, and of course pentesting. I was an InfoSec professional for a number of years and a programmer for even longer, and no two days has ever been the same, and I plan to keep it that way! I know that no one can ever never know everything in this industry, but that‚Äôs the fun part.
                Anyways, that‚Äôs just a little bit about me for now, hopefully you follow me on this random journey. Talk you later! Send me a message on the social medias if you dare. I will respond. üôÇ
